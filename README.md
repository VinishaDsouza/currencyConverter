# Currency Converter App
-To run the app locally, open index.html file.

-You can run the app on this link :)

-To Do:
I recognize there is code repetition in my index.html file, my next step is to modularize the code base, possibly creating a template
I also think I should make my app mobile friendly and write unit tests
